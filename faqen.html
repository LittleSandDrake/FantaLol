<strong>HOW DO I GET TO CREATE/MANAGE A TEAM?</strong> <br> <br>
On the main page of our website there is a special button for Login/Sign Up, so you can create your own FANTA ESPORTS profile. Then in the "Create your LEAGUE" section we will show all the steps to create the competition and the team that will compete in the League, all in minutes!
If you have been invited to participate in a competition, just follow the instructions given in the invitation link. <br> <strong> CREATE YOUR LEAGUE AND HAVE FUN!</strong> <br> <br> <br>
<strong>HOW MUCH DOES FANTA ESPORTS COSTS?</strong> <br> <br>
Creating your own profile will always be free, while creating a League will cost the same for all participants, decided by the users. This implies that participants have to agree on the cost and, consequently, on the prizes of the competition. However, this does not apply to the Global League, which is free. <br> <br> <br>
<strong>ARE THERE ANY PRIZES FOR THE WINNER OF THE GLOBAL LEAGUE?</strong> <br> <br>
The awards are announced every year at the start of the competition. Expect EVERYTHING! <br> <br> <br>
<strong>CAN I RENAME MY LEAGUE AND MY TEAM?</strong> <br> <br>
The League, and therefore your own team, is completely customizable from the League page. You can also add cover photos, sweaters and more! <br> <br> <br>

<strong>WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE WITH THE FRIEND LEAGUE AND THE GLOBAL ONE?</strong> <br> <br>
You can choose whether to create your Friend League "Private" or "Public". The first is reserved for users chosen by the creator of the League itself, who will pay the agreed amount, and who will be able to access it only through the link generated by the system. The second one is free entry, but always paid (this time decided by the creator of the League), and can be accessed via the League search bar, for the first time. The Global League, on the other hand, is open to all profile users and is completely free. All the leagues you participate in will be available in the "My Leagues" section in your profile. <br> <br> <br>
<strong>WHICH OFFICIAL LEAGUES CAN I CHOOSE FOR MY VIRTUAL LEAGUE?</strong> <br> <br>
On FANTA ESPORTS you can create your own League by choosing from the major professional leagues of League of Legends: LEC (EU), LCS (USA), LCK (KR), LPL (CHI). <br> <br> <br>
<strong>HOW DO I KNOW MY GLOBAL RANKING?</strong> <br> <br>
On the site there is the section of the "Global League", which is similar in all to the Friend Leagues section. It shows the updated position of all participants and also your own, as well as showing users' teams. <br> <br> <br>
<strong>WHAT CAN I CREATE AND IN THE WAY OF THE ENTRY?</strong> <br> <br>
At the moment we have a limit of 20 leagues that you can participate in or can create. <br> <br> <br> 
<strong>CAN I CREATE A LEAGUE AND SELECT THE PLAYERS AFTER THE COMPETITIVE SEASONâ€™S START?</strong> <br> <br>
Once created, the team cannot be modified unless roster changes or injuries prevent the team from being fully deployed. As for creating Leagues after the start of competitive seasons, it is possible, but the scores remain up to date on the start day of the virtual competition (for example, if you create your own League in the second week of LEC, the count of the points will ignore the first week of competition). <br> <br> <br>
<strong>CAN I CANCEL MY LEAGUE?</strong> <br> <br>
Leagues can be deleted at any time from the League page, with the "Delete League" button. The registration fee will be refunded in total. <br> <br> <br>
<strong>HOW DO I CHANGE THE ROSTER?</strong> <br> <br>
The formations can only be modified at the beginning of each week. Any changes you make later will not be applied. Check your active line-up on time, or your players will be in danger of staying on the bench! <br> <br> <br>
<strong>WHERE DO I FIND THE LISTS OF PLAYERS AND THE QUOTES?</strong> <br> <br>
The list of Pro Players and their quotes will be available once the League membership is finalized, within the League page itself. It will also be published and updated every year on our social profiles. So follow us and stay up to date on the FANTA ESPORTS world. <br> <br> <br> 
<strong>ARE PLAYOFFS INCLUDED IN THE FANTA ESPORTS SEASONS?</strong> <br> <br>
No, only the games of the season, before the playoffs. This applies to each Reference League chosen during creation. <br> <br> <br>
<strong>HOW DO YOU CALCULATE THE SCORES FOR PLAYERS?</strong> <br> <br>
Scores are calculated according to the performance of the single Pro Player during his regular season, and then added to the rest of the lineup, to give the Team Score. The score rules are written in the "Scores" section. <br> <br> <br>
