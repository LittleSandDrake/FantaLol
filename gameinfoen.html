  			<h2><strong>FANTA ESPORTS</strong> is the new game that allows you to create a  <strong>complete Pro Players League of Legends team</strong>  from scratch and have it fight in a League formed by the users themselves. <br> <br> 
At the beginning of the creation of the competition, players choose the professional league of reference (LEC, LCS, LPL or LCK) and the number of players who will participate, which varies from 2 to 10 users. <br> <br>
Then we move on the payment, decided by the participants, which will define the cash prizes up for grabs: the higher the entry fee, the higher the <strong>prizes</strong>. <br> <br>
Once all users have adjusted the payment, you get to the thick of the game. 
Depending on the professional league you will have a pool of players that can be selected for your team, which are precisely the <strong>Pro Players</strong>that play there. <br> <br> 
Each participant will have a budget of <strong>100 FE-credits</strong> usable to buy players for their team. Draft includes a complete roster of players: Toplaner, Jungler, Midlaner, ADC, Support and a variable role substitute (given the possible changes of roster within the real teams).
Each player will have an updated and balanced credit value every year depending on their performance in regional and international tournaments. <br> <br>
Once you have completed your team of champions, you move on to the <strong>clashes:</strong>each League will have a duration equal to the reference competition (e.g. 18 weeks in the case of LEC) and the scores will be calculated depending on the real performance of the players in their league matches. <br> <br>
At the end of the competition, the team of each player will have reached a <strong>total score </strong> that will be the sum of the individuals (to check the score is provided for the appropriate SCORES section) and, clearly, who will have the highest score within the League will come first, the second score in second place and so on. <br> <br>
In the case of drastic changes of roster or the forced absence of a player, the credits spent for an absent player will be refunded and it will be possible to take a new player to return to the best level of competition (depending on how many FE-credits are left to the user). <br> <br>
It will be possible change your roster every week before the competitive days begin, but it will not be possible change your team during the days in which the games are played. <br> <br>
<strong>CREATE YOUR OWN LEAGUE AND HAVE FUN WITH YOUR FRIENDS!</strong>
